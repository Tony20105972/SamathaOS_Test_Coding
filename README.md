# SamathaOS_Test_Coding
🧪 Samantha OS HomePage Test Coding Remade

🎯 Purpose

The first home page of Samantha OS is re-implemented with Python-based web framework Reflex to establish a lightweight UI/UX base that can be integrated with the entire AgentLayer platform in the future. The purpose of this code is to compare and verify with the existing React/Vercel-based structure, and to test the flexibility and configuration method of the Reflex-based structure.

📌 Overview

Framework: Reflex

Purpose: Global Navigation, Initial Hero Section, Footer Configuration Test

Goals for the future: Agent Builder, Construction Viewer, Workflow Executor, etc

🔧 Development environment

Python 3.10+

Reflex (Latest Version)

virtual environment: venv or poetry (recommended: python -mvenv.venv)

🏗️ Basic Structure

my_reflex_app/
├-- app.py #Main Entry Point
├── components/
│ └-- global_nav.py #global navigation
├── pages/
│ └-- index.py #Home Page
├── styles/
│ └-- theme.py # Default Theme Settings (Optional)
└-- .venv/# Virtual Environments

✨ Inclusive Features (Test Range)

Global Navigation (logo + link + WalletConnect button)

Navigation Hover/Active Style

Consider mobile menus in later versions

🧪 Test Criteria

Is it possible to rescue with only a combination of Reflex components?

Compatibility with existing React structures (logic translation degree)

Expression compared to Tailwind-style configurations

Ease of future agent execution and construction integration

📍 Utilize results

Determine whether to refact the entire Samantha OS page with Reflex based on this structure
